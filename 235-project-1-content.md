Concept
=======

Players will train their group of creatures in sorcery to battle the CPU
in this turn-based roll playing-game.

Lore
====

421 years in the future humans have found extraterrestrial life. It
didn't take long for people to realize these alien species have magic
powers. After years of studying their behavior. Enthusiast have mastered
the technique of teaching them hexes. Different species can learn
different move sets. Some Are also stronger against specific species
than other. A culture of harmless battling emerged. Two contenders each
get 4 random aliens. They have a set amount of Hex Points which they can
use to make their move sets. Each contender does not know the other
contenders species or moves until they are played in the match. The goal
is to immobilize the other competitors aliens before yours are. The game
is easy to pick up but takes practice to become a good player. It is the
perfect blend between chance and strategy.

HEXtraterrestrial's battles were inspired by the battles in the popular
game series Final Fantasy.

Esthetics/Controls
==================

This game will be on web only. It will have an old-school game style
with pixel art sprites and 8-bit audio. Sound effects will help the
player learn between making smart moves and making mistakes. Energetic
music in the background will give the player a thrilling vibe. To make
the game simple to learn, the same will be played entirely with the
mouse. Speed is not a factor in the game so clicking on move or other
button options is the simplest controls to use.

Gameplay
========

The game is taught by a master character guiding the player through
their choices in the first match. After that, learning is about
experimentation and just having fun while playing.

Developer Bio
=============

Justin Blake was the sole developer of this amazing game. He is a Game
Design & Development student at Rochester Institute of Technology. He is
obviously interested in video game design and development but his other
hobbies include watching sports, listening to music, fishing and just
hanging out with the boys. His top five favorite childhood games are The
Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Mario Bros. 3, Crash
Bandicoot, Resident Evil, and various Pokemon titles (Gen I - III,
Emerald was the first one I beat).

To-Do
=====

The website is already responsive but I would like to decrease the font
size for narrower displays. I would also like to implement either Flex
Box or CSS Grid. It isn't required for my design however it would be
nice to add some just to show I am capable of using it. The images need
to either be replaced or accompanied by screenshots from the actual game
when it is complete or maybe some game sprites once they are made.
Finally, I need to add a feature that tells the user which page they are
on in the nav by either changing the background or the text color. Of
course I will also adjust the site after I receive feedback. If I have
time, I would like to replace the HEXtraterrestrial heading on all the
pages with a logo.

Process
=======

So far I have created the basic framework for the website. I have
created a game idea and outlined its details in the Proposal tab. I also
found reference images from other games as inspiration for my game. I
have marked up the HTML semantically and with id and class tags when
appropriate. I decided on a color scheme that is meant to look
extraterrestrial but also playful because after all it is a game
website.
